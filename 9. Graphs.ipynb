    "# Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph is a fundamental data structure in computer science and mathematics used to represent a collection of interconnected nodes or vertices and the edges or connections between them. Graphs are used to model a wide range of real-world relationships and networks, such as social networks, transportation systems, computer networks, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Terminoligies:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Node (Vertex):** A node, often referred to as a vertex, is a fundamental unit of a graph. It can represent an entity, object, or point in the graph. Nodes can have attributes or properties associated with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Edge:** An edge is a connection between two nodes in a graph. It represents a relationship or interaction between the connected nodes. Edges can be directed or undirected, depending on whether they have a specific direction or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Directed Graph (Digraph):** In a directed graph, edges have a direction, meaning they go from one node (the source or tail) to another (the target or head). These are often used to represent relationships with a clear direction, such as one-way roads or dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Undirected Graph:** In an undirected graph, edges do not have a direction. They simply represent a symmetric relationship between nodes, where the connection is bidirectional.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Weighted Graph:** In a weighted graph, each edge is assigned a weight or cost, which can represent some numerical value associated with the relationship between nodes. Weighted graphs are used in various applications, such as finding the shortest path in a network.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Cyclic vs. Acyclic Graphs:** A graph can be cyclic if it contains one or more cycles (loops) where you can follow a sequence of edges and return to the same node. An acyclic graph has no cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Connected vs. Disconnected Graphs:** A connected graph is one in which there is a path between any pair of nodes. In contrast, a disconnected graph consists of multiple connected components, where there is no path between nodes in different components.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Degree of a Node:** The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it. In a directed graph, nodes can have both in-degrees (incoming edges) and out-degrees (outgoing edges).\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Graph Representation:** Graphs can be represented using various data structures, including adjacency matrices, adjacency lists, and edge lists. The choice of representation depends on the specific problem and the operations you need to perform efficiently.\r",
    ".10\n",
    "\r\n",
    "2. **Adjacent Vertices**: In a graph, if two vertices are connected by an edge, they are considered adjacent to each other. In an undirected graph, the relationship is symmetric, meaning if vertex A is adjacent to vertex B, then vertex B is also adjacent to vertext11x).\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "4. **Path**: A path in a graph is a sequence of vertices in which each adjacent pair is connected by an edge. A path can be used to represent a route or a sequence of steps from one vertex to another within thec12mponents.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "7. **Tree**: A tree is a special type of graph that has the following properties:\r\n",
    "   - It is a connected graph, meaning there is a path between any two vertices.\r\n",
    "   - It is acyclic, which means it has no cycles or loops.\r\n",
    "   - There is a unique path between any pair of vertices in a tree.\r\n",
    "   - In a tree, you can traverse from the root (top) to the leaves (bottom) following the edges, but you can't traverse upwards (from child to parent) in tlinguistics, among others."

    "Time Complexity in Graphs:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a graph with n vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The minimum number of edges in a graph with n vertices is 0. This means that it is possible to have a graph with no edges, where each vertex is isolated from the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In a connected graph with n vertices, the minimum number of edges required to ensure connectivity is n-1. This minimal number of edges forms a spanning tree, allowing you to reach any vertex from any other vertex in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If the number of edges in the graph is equal to or greater than n, then there will be at least one cycle in the graph. This is because the presence of additional edges beyond n would create paths that loop back to previously visited vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. To find the maximum number of edges in a connected graph with n vertices, you can consider the following:\n",
    "   - The first node can be connected to n-1 other nodes.\n",
    "   - The second node can be connected to n-2 other nodes (excluding the first node).\n",
    "   - This pattern continues until the last node, which can be connected to 1 other node.\n",
    "   - Therefore, the maximum number of edges in a connected graph with n vertices is given by the sum of the series 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (n-1), which can be calculated as n*(n-1)/2."
